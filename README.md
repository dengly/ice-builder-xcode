# Ice Builder for Xcode
Ice Builder for Xcode is an Xcode plug-in to compile Slice files to
C++ or Objective-C.

The builder manages all aspects of code generation, including
automatically recompiling Slice files that have changed, removing
obsolete generated classes, and tracking dependencies.

## Install

We recommend using Alcatraz (http://alcatraz.io) to install the
builder. Look for Ice Builder in the Alcatraz package list and click
`Install` to install it. Restart Xcode after the plug-in installation.

If not using Alcatraz, open and build the IceBuilder Xcode project
from this repository to install the Xcode plug-in in:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins
```
Restart Xcode after the plug-in installation.

To uninstall the plug-in, remove `IceBuilder.xcplugin` from:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins
```
If you have a previous version of the Ice Touch Xcode Plug-in installed, you must remove the following symbolic link to disable it:
```
$ sudo rm /Library/Application Support/Developer/6.2/Xcode/Plug-ins/slice2objcplugin.pbplugin
```
Replace 6.2 in the path above with the Xcode version you're using.

## Usage

### Adding Slice Files to an Xcode Project

To add an existing Slice file, select a folder in the project, select File, and
choose Add -> Existing Files...

To create a new Slice file, select a folder in the project, select File, and
choose New -> New Files... Select the Other category and choose Empty File as
the file type. Save the file with a .ice extension.

### Configuring Xcode Project Settings

The Xcode plug-in is configured using the per-target info build settings, just
as you would configure the compiler settings. Select a target, and then select
the build settings tab, and *enter Slice in the Search in Build Settings* field.

|Setting|Name|Description|
|-------|--------|-----------|
|Header Directory|`SLICE_INCLUDE_DIR`|Directory to use as the header include directory in source files.|
|Header Search Paths|`SLICE_INCLUDE_PATH`|The list of directories to search for included Slice files (`-I` option). Note that the Ice Slice files are automatically in the header search path|
|Ice Home|`SLICE_ICE_HOME`| If you are building with Ice Touch, this should be left unset; otherwise, if using a homebrew Ice installation or regular Ice, set this to the location of the installation (e.g.: `/usr/local` or `/Library/Developer/Ice-3.5`).|
|Output Directory|`SLICE_OUTPUT_DIR`|Directory to place files generated by the Slice compiler.|
|Permit `Ice` prefix|`SLICE_ICE_FLAG`|Pass `--ice` to the Slice compiler.|
|Streaming support|`SLICE_STREAM_FLAG`|Pass `--stream` to the Slice compiler (C++ only).|
|Checksum support|`SLICE_CHECKSUM_FLAG`|Pass `--checksum` to the Slice compiler (C++ only).|
|Preprocessor Macros|`SLICE_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`|Set the list of preprocessor macros to define (`-D` option).|
|Translate C++ code|`SLICE_CPP_FLAG`|Leave this option unset for an SDK build. For non-SDK builds, setting this option means slice2cpp is used to compile the Slice files; otherwise, slice2objc is used.|
|Underscore support|`SLICE_UNDERSCORE_FLAG`|Pass `--underscore` to the Slice compiler.|
|Link with Ice services client libraries|`SLICE_LINK_WITH_SERVICES`|Link with Glacier2, IceStorm and IceGrid client libraries.|

You can also define Slice compiler options for individual Slice source files.
Select your project in the Project Navigator, select the relevant target (you
may have only one), then select the Build Phases tab, expand the Compile
Sources phase and the Compiler Flags column lets you set each file's options
for that target.

### Xcode Project Settings for Cocoa and iPhone Applications

For Cocoa and iPhone applications, which use the IceTouch Xcode SDK, you must
add the appropriate directory to the `Additional SDKs` setting:

| Language        | Location                                               |
 -----------------| -------------------------------------------------------
| Objective-C SDK | `/Library/Developer/IceTouch-1.3/SDKs/ObjC/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk` |
| C++ SDK         | `/Library/Developer/IceTouch-1.3/SDKs/Cpp/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk`  |

You must also add the following to the Frameworks folder:
- `Security.framework` (OS X and iOS)
- `CFNetwork.framework` (iOS only)

### Configuring Non-SDK Builds

For non-SDK builds, you must configure the location of the Ice header
and library directories. Under the Search Paths section in the project
build settings:
* Add `Ice installation/include` to the Header Search Paths setting.
* Add `Ice installation/lib` to the Library Search Paths setting.

### Generating Code using Xcode

The builder compiles a Slice file whenever you build the project. The
extension tracks dependencies among Slice files in the project and
recompiles only those files that require it after a change.
