# Xcode Compiler Plug-In
Xcode plug-in to compile Slice files to C++ or Objective-C with Xcode.

The Xcode plug-in manages all aspects of code generation, including
automatically recompiling Slice files that have changed, removing obsolete
generated classes, and tracking dependencies.

## Install

We recommend using Alcatraz (http://alcatraz.io) to install the plug-in. Look
for IceTouchPlugin in the Alcatraz package list and click Install to install
it. Restart Xcode after the plug-in installation.

If not using Alcatraz, open and build the IceTouchPlugin Xcode project from
this repository to install the Xcode Plugin-In in
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins. Restart Xcode
after the plug-in installation. To uninstall the plug-in, remove
IceTouchPlugin.xcplugin from
~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins.

## Usage

### Adding Slice Files to an Xcode Project

To add an existing Slice file, select a folder in the project, select File, and
choose Add -> Existing Files...

To create a new Slice file, select a folder in the project, select File, and
choose New -> New Files... Select the Other category and choose Empty File as
the file type. Save the file with a .ice extension.

### Configuring Xcode Project Settings

The Xcode plug-in is configured using the per-target info build settings, just
as you would configure the compiler settings. Select a target, and then select
the build settings tab, and *enter Slice in the Search in Build Settings* field.

* Header Directory: Directory to use as the header include directory in source
  files.
* Header Search Paths: The list of directories to search for included Slice
  files (-I option). Note that the Ice Slice files are automatically in the
  header search path.
* Ice Home: If you are building with the Ice Touch Xcode SDK, this should be
  left unset; otherwise, if using a homebrew  Ice installation or regular Ice,
  set this to the location of the installation (e.g.: /usr/local or
  /opt/Ice-3.6.0).
* Output Directory: Directory to place files generated by the Slice compiler.
* Permit `Ice' prefix: Pass --ice to the Slice compiler.
* Streaming support: Pass --stream to the Slice compiler (C++ only).
* Checksum support: Pass --checksum to the Slice compiler (C++ only).
* Preprocessor Macros: Set the list of preprocessor macros to define (-D
  option).
* Translate C++ code: Leave this option unset for an SDK build. For non-SDK
  builds, setting this option means slice2cpp is used to compile the Slice
  files; otherwise, slice2objc is used.
* Underscore support: Pass --underscore to the Slice compiler.
* Link with Ice services client libraries: Link with Glacier2, IceStorm and
  IceGrid client libraries.

You can also define Slice compiler options for individual Slice source files.
Select your project in the Project Navigator, select the relevant target (you
may have only one), then select the Build Phases tab, expand the Compile
Sources phase and the Compiler Flags column lets you set each file's options
for that target.

### Xcode Project Settings for Cocoa and iPhone Applications

For Cocoa and iPhone applications, which use the IceTouch Xcode SDK, you must
add the appropriate directory to Additional SDKs:

| Language        | Location                                               |
 -----------------| -------------------------------------------------------
| Objective-C SDK | /usr/local/opt/icetouch/SDKs/ObjC/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk |
| C++ SDK         | /usr/local/opt/icetouch/SDKs/Cpp/$(PLATFORM_NAME).sdk  |

You must also add the following to the Frameworks folder:
* CFNetwork.framework
* Security.framework
* Foundation.framework

### Configuring Non-SDK Builds

For non-SDK builds, you must configure the location of the Ice header and
library directories. Under the Search Paths section in the project build
settings:
* Add <Ice installation>/include to the Header Search Paths setting.
* Add <Ice installation>/lib to the Library Search Paths setting.

### Generating Code using Xcode

The plug-in compiles a Slice file whenever you build the project. The extension
tracks dependencies among Slice files in the project and recompiles only those
files that require it after a change.
